# Recommendation-System

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation of a Movie Recommender System that provides personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences and interactions. The system utilizes collaborative filtering and/or content-based approaches for delivering recommendations.

## Project Overview

Movie recommendation systems have become integral to platforms like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video. This project focuses on building an effective recommender system using machine learning techniques to enhance user engagement and satisfaction.

## Features
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for insights
- Collaborative Filtering and/or Content-Based Recommendation techniques
- Model evaluation and tuning for improved accuracy

## File Structure
- `movie-recommender-system.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation and analysis.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- surprise (for collaborative filtering models, if applicable)

Install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn surprise
```

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-recommender-system.git
   cd movie-recommender-system
   ```
2. Install the necessary dependencies as listed in the requirements section.
3. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook movie-recommender-system.ipynb
   ```
4. Run the cells sequentially to load data, process it, and generate movie recommendations.

## Data
Ensure that you have the dataset required for training and testing the recommendation system. The dataset should include information such as:
- User preferences or ratings
- Movie metadata (e.g., genre, cast, synopsis)

You can modify the notebook to accommodate your specific dataset format.

## Evaluation
The performance of the recommender system is evaluated using:
- Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Precision@K, Recall@K (for top-K recommendations)

## Results
The project demonstrates how various recommendation algorithms perform and their strengths/weaknesses. Check the notebook for detailed performance metrics and recommendations generated by the system.

## Contributions
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to fork this repository, add features, and submit pull requests to enhance the system.
